# How to install Motorola USB Drivers on Windows 10 or 11

## Installation

1. Just clone this repo or download as a zip package.

2. Then execute `setup.bat` (**Notes: Please run as Administrator**). That's all.

## Explanation

Because the “Motorola USB driver v6.4.0” from [Motorola Support](https://en-gb.support.motorola.com/app/usb-drivers) can't install properly in Windows 11 (It will end up with an error), that's why I made this driver installation batch file.

The USB drivers are extracted from the following sources:

* [Google USB Driver](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb)
* [Rescue and Smart Assistant - Motorola Support](https://en-gb.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/158726)
